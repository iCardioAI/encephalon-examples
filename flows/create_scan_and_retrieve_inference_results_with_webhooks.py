"""
Learn Flow 2: Webhook-based workflow for scalable cardiac AI integration.

This example teaches you the webhook approach (API Only) for building high-performance,
server-to-server integrations with Encephalon. You'll learn how to eliminate polling
overhead and build systems that scale efficiently.

What you'll learn:
1. How to configure webhook endpoints for real-time notifications
2. How to handle asynchronous AI analysis completion events
3. How to build efficient server-to-server integrations
4. How to process webhook payloads and retrieve full analysis results

This approach is ideal for high-volume processing, server applications, batch systems,
or any integration where you want to minimize API calls and maximize efficiency.

Key advantages: No polling overhead, real-time notifications, better scalability,
reduced server load, and immediate response to analysis completion.
